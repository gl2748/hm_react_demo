App per instructions:
```
      - Write a React/Redux app with a container component and inside are two form components.
      - Only one form component should be visible at a time. Links or some other sort of state should manage which is visible.
      - Default data for each form should be provided by relevant reducers.
      - Simulate save by updating reducer with form data. Also acceptable to update reducer on each form input change.
      - Utilize flexbox in both forms for things like side by side inputs. The input positioning should change on mobile views responsively.
      - These specs are a little loose to just see how you approach the problem. Doing more than what is described above is allowed.
      - If you want to put this through Webpack to make it functional, that’s also fine, but not mandatory
```
